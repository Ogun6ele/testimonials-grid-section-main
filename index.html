              I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, 
              in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny&apos;s worth.

              &quot; I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I&apos;ve been looking to make a 
              transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
              for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
              The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
              the course, I&apos;ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. &quot;

              Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and 
              learning from their experiences was easy.

            <p class="feedback">
              &quot; The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program 
              gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable 
              junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from 
              an incredible community of smart and amazing people. &quot;

          <p class="feedback">
            &quot; Before joining the bootcamp, I&apos;ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from 
            professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
            student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
            did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
            project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
            could ever have. In fact, I&apos;ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
            experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
            100% recommend! &quot;
